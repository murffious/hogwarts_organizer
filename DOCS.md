Materialize_react

Notes:
Went for 100% but missed it.  Front end CRUD and BUTTONS to use CRUD not done but api file almost done. Does show my understanding as I have many projects done showing I know this stuff on my GitHub link on resume see emailsurveysapp and toyotaclone and many others. 


Include a Mongo version and maybe AWS stuff
Host on Digital Ocean and or Heroku
put on portfolio


DB design
Any able to help me with a db design for a practice project I am doing? SQL DB  with Sequelize if that makes a difference...  I have 3 tables so far any ideas thank you!
Students--> Name then connections to their Courses and Grades for each 
 Courses  --> Name of course and maybe an attachment, and 
Grades ---> their will be a generic 10 assignments for now not even sure how to deal with those but the grades for each course for each student
like 

grades : foregin key : 2 student reference
