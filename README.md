# Full Stack Test

Albus Dumbledore can no longer rely on magic and his brain to keep track of all the students that attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the courses they were enrolled in, and what grade they received for the course. He has commissioned you, a muggle, to build a backend to store this information (students, courses, grades) for him with an API to access this data. He would also like a web interface (in React) to be able to perform CRUD operations on this data. These are Dumbledoreâ€™s requirements:

* The database and application manages data for a single school year
* The database used to store the data should be a relational database (preferably MySQL)
* The API should follow REST or GraphQL best practices
* The backend should be implemented in one of the following languages: NodeJS, PHP, Java
* Create CRUD endpoints for the data models
* Create a React interface that will facilitate the following functionality:
    * Viewing students
    * Editing students
    * Creating new students
    * Deleting students
* Create a React interface that will facilitate the following functionality:
    * Viewing courses
    * Editing courses
    * Creating new courses
    * Deleting courses
* Implement one or more of the following on the front-end:
    * Client side search on students
    * Paginated list for viewing students
    * Paginated list for viewing courses
    * Drag and drop interface for enrolling students into courses
    * Interface for assigning grades to students for the courses that they are enrolled in.
 Some bonus include:
* Server-side search on students
* Custom endpoint for calculating cumulative GPA based on grade

## Docker Instructions

Instructions for docker compose:
* Make sure docker is installed
    * For Mac: https://www.docker.com/docker-mac
    * For Windows: https://www.docker.com/docker-windows
    * For Ubuntu: https://www.docker.com/docker-ubuntu
* Make sure you're in the same directory as this readme
* run `docker-compose up -d`
    * This will create a container called mysqldb
    * To verify it was created you can run `docker ps` -- it should show up in the list of containers
* To tear down your environment you can run `docker-compose down` so that you can spin it from scratch as you make changes
* In this same directory there is a schemadump.sql file which is where you should put the DDL for creating your schema. The database name is `test` which is consistent with what is specified in the docker-compose.yml file
* The schemadump.sql script should automatically run when the pod spins up
    * If you get an error like `ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)` then just wait a minute or two for mysql to fully initialize and then try again
* To bash into your mysql container you can run `docker exec -it mysqldb bash` and you can either login to MySQL with user:root pass:root or user:test pass:test
* Complete the docker-compose.yml file with your api service
* Refer to https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/ for the official Docker Compose tutorial

## Grading
